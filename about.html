          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I am an Engineering student pursuing my B.tech at Marwadi University in computer science with specialization
               in Artificail Intelligence. I code in Python, C++, Javascript and some of PHP, I primarily use Python 
               for back-end, web-scrapping, file-handling and more, have made some projects using Python. My projects 
               includes snake game, tic-tac-toe that I have made using Pygame, and a blog that I have made using Django, 
               a market web-app where customers can sell and buy items.
          </p>
          <p>My goal is to learn computer science core concepts like data structures, algorithms design, os, I am 
                regularly working in actively learning new things and am always ready to be approached to work on to 
                open source projects.
          </p>

          <!-- <p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation
            process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout
            the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end
            user.
          </p>

          <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
            according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
            with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p> -->
